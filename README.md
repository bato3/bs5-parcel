## What it is?

It my tests witch tweak bootstrap for me. (And try add missing parts in https://illright.github.io/attractions/docs/components/typography)

## About

The **Bootstrap npm starter** is a GitHub template repository for quickly creating new [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)-powered projects with npm and [Parcel 2](https://v2.parceljs.org). Click `Use this template` above, or clone/download it as your own Bootstrap prototyping sandbox.

**Why Parcel?** Parcel compiles all our code—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—quickly and easily for local development and production. Setup is straightforward, build tool depdencies are automatically handled, and there's flexibility for additional enhancements.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter/actions)

## What's included

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) v5.1.0
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com) v1.5.0
- [Parcel](https://v2.parceljs.org) v2.x for local development

Parcel provides a `serve`/`watch` task for local development and a `build` task for compiling a production-ready static site. Also included is Sass compiling, PostCSS/Autoprefix support, PurgeCSS support (via plugin), and JavaScript importing and compiling.
